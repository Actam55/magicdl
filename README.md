# Welcome to Magicdl!

Magicdl is a game inspired by Wordle, but where you guess Magic the Gathering cards with unlimited attempts.
It is a web application that allows you to guess the name of a Magic the Gathering card based on its attributes, such as color, type, and rarity. The game is designed to be fun and challenging for Magic the Gathering fans and players.

The game is a project I am working on to practice web development skills, including Blazor, HTML, and CSS.
